# Portfolio Updates
I've been working on some updates to my portfolio, and I'm excited to share them with you!
The Main Bio page should be a bit more readable now, have made some changes to the layout and letter spacing. I've also updated my skills and education sections
these now feature clickable links the open a model with relevant information.

The Blog has now been updated to allow for filtering by tag, now those pesky tag badges dont just look clickable, they are!

import ExternalLink from '@components/ExternalLink.astro'


I've started this portfolio and blog to share my projects and experiences with the world, built as a static site using
<ExternalLink href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</ExternalLink>
making it fast and easy to maintain while allowing me to choose any front-end framework I want.

Currently the site is hosted on GitHub Pages, meaning it's open-source and accessible to anyone who wants to view it.
Using git also allows it to integrate seamlessly with Astro's content system, making it easy to deploy and update my site as I add content.
You can find the source code for this site on <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/therosin/therosin.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</ExternalLink>.
